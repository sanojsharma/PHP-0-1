# 🛠 **Setting Up Your PHP Environment!**  

Before writing and running PHP code, you need to set up a working PHP environment on your computer. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## 🔹 **What You Need to Run PHP**  
PHP is a **server-side language**, which means it requires a web server to execute scripts. To run PHP locally, you'll need:  

1. **PHP** – The core scripting language.  
2. **A Web Server** – Such as Apache or Nginx.  
3. **A Database (Optional)** – MySQL or MariaDB for database-driven applications.  

The easiest way to install everything is by using an **all-in-one package** like **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **MAMP**.

## 🔥 Installing XAMPP (Recommended for Beginners)**
