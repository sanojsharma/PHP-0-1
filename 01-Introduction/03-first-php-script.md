## ✨ **Writing Your First PHP Script**  
Now that PHP is installed, let’s write our first script!  

1️⃣ Open a text editor (VS Code, Sublime, or Notepad++).  
2️⃣ Create a new file named `index.php`.  
3️⃣ Add the following code:  

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, PHP!";
?>
```

4️⃣ Save the file inside the `htdocs` folder (Eg: `C:\xampp\htdocs\index.php` for XAMPP users).  
5️⃣ Open your browser and visit:  

```
http://localhost/index.php
```

You should see:  
```
Hello, PHP!
```
🎉 **Congratulations! You just ran your first PHP script!**
